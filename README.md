In order to run the ValidationClass.java file, you need to have Selenium 4 or higher installed.
In order to do that, you need to have Java installed in your laptop and Java global variables declared.
This is a maven project and you can check all dependencies on the pom.xml file on the project root.
About the Pages package, I created all the locators needed to create the test cases on the ValidationClass.java.
You can also see that there are a couple of locators and functions that weren't used, that is because I created two different functions to do the same thing, and later on, I decided to go with the later option.
By executing ValidationClass.java you will be able to run the test cases.
